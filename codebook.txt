This is a description of the data table tidy.txt.

The original data was collected from cell phone sensors from 30 volunteers doing 6 different activities (Walking, Walking up stairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing, and laying).
The data was preprocessed and a total of 561 features were extracted over the time domain (for each subject and each activity). 

Original data described on this website:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The data source is here:

For the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course, this project manipulated the data further and the processed data was output to a file called tidy.txt.
Manipulations were done using the R script "run_analysis.R".
The script takes 7 input files:

	"features.txt"
	"X_test.txt"
	"Y_test.txt"
	"X_train.txt"
	"Y_train.txt"
	"subject_test.txt"
	"subject_train.txt"
	
From these files, a data frame was created with labeled columns corresponding to the column's measurement as well as a column denoting the subject number and the activity.

Only the means and standard deviation observations were subsetted and used (79 features).

For each subject and activity pair, (6*30 = 180 pairs), the mean of each of the 79 features were calculated and placed in ""tidy.txt".

tidy.txt has dimensions: 81 columns, 180 rows.

Each row is a subject activity pair.
The first column indicates the subject number.  The second column indicates the activity.
Columns 3 through 81 is the mean of the indicated feature for each subject/activity pair.

These features are:
"tBodyAcc-mean()-X"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
"tBodyAcc-std()-X"
